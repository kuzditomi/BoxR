## About BoxR

BoxR is an implementation of the game known as dots and boxes. You can find more about the game on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes).

The multiplayer is based on [SignalR](http://signalr.net/), the main parts are written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).
In the project you can find two versions of the game, one written for ASP.NET 4.5, and another written to Windows 8 store. One of my goals with the project is the shared codebase of the projects. You can find them in production also:
